# Auto-Using for C#
Auto-imports and provides intellisense for references that were not yet imported in a C# file.

Works for extension methods. No more being confused that linq methods don't exist.

Gives priority to completions that were chosen before.

Sometimes there are multiple completions with the same name. In that case they are compressed into a single completion and you get to choose between them.

## Changelog

### 0.7.9
- Fixed the 1.20.0 version of the C# extension breaking this extension.

### 0.7.8
- Fixed `using` expressions being placed above preprocessor statements (this also makes the extension more compatible with C# script files).

### 0.7.7
- Fixed the extension hanging when used in an empty file.

### 0.7.4 
- Fixed extension methods not appearing for arrays.

### 0.7.3 
- Fixed extension methods not appearing after method calls with parameters, and after variables enclosed in parentheses. 
- Fixed certain extension method options sometimes not appearing 


### 0.7.2
- Fixed completions not appearing after the `in` keyword (relevant for `foreach` loops).
- Fixed extension methods not appearing for fully qualified paths. 

### 0.7.0
- Auto-Using now Auto-Imports extension methods! Using Linq has never been easier.
- Fixed completions appearing when typing space unlike the C# extensions, which causes completions to seem like they are happening for no reason.

### 0.6.12
- Fixed completions not appearing after the "this" keyword (matters for writing extension methods).

### 0.6.1
- Improved time it takes to provide completions from "essentialy nothing" to "actually nothing most of the time and almost actually nothing the rest of the time". (Thanks for the Auto-Import ext for a cool idea)

### 0.6.0
- Improved time it takes to provide completions from at least 0.4 seconds to essentialy nothing.

### 0.5.0 
- When there are two or more types with the same name, a (sorted based on your previously selected completions) quick pick menu will show up, giving you an option to choose between the different namespaces. 

### 0.4.0 
- Completions no longer appear when typing a variable name.

If completions are appearing when they shouldn't, or not appearing when they should, please make an issue. 

### 0.3.3
- Increased the amount of references you can import from mscorelib (~900 references) to entire .NET base library (~3000 references).

If there is something missing from the base classes please make an issue.

### 0.2.3 
No more of that weird prefix stuff, completions that you have never chosen will be deprioitized but not prefixed. 

### 0.2.0
Removed unnecessary files

### 0.1.0
In an attempt to prevent this extension from cluttering Intellisense:
- Import completions you have chosen before will now get an highly increased priority
- Import completions you have never chosen will be prefixed (configurable) to highly reduce their priority.

### 0.0.3
Released
